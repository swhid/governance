# Scope

The Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) specification defines an open standard for communicating software bill of material (SBOM) information.

SPDX defines an underlying data model as well as multiple serialization formats to encode that data model.

SPDX metadata includes details about software creation and distribution, including the following:
* software composition, for collections of software (Packages), individual Files, and portions of files (Snippets)
* software build information
* creator, supplier and distributor identity information
* provenance and integrity
* licenses and copyrights, including a curated list of licenses and exceptions
* security vulnerabilities, defects, and other quality data
* relationships between software elements
* software usage and lifecycle
* mechanisms to enable annotating SPDX elements and linking between multiple SPDX Documents

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.

# Scope

The Software Heritage Identifier (SWHID) specification defines an open standard
for identifiers of digital objects.

This standard defines the syntax, description and precise computation process
for a SWHID, which is intended to provide unique identification, guarantee
integrity and enable provenance tracking of digital objects that may have, and
be part of, a hierarchical structure.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.

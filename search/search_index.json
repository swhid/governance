It is derived from the Community Specifications Governance Policy 1.0 . Any participation in the project must adhere to the requirements in this document. 1. Scope The SWHID Project entails the development and maintenance of the SWHID specification, software and other related content. Activities of the project might also include outreach activities to promote the use of SWHID by the broader community and ecosystem. 2. Roles and Responsibilities. The Project includes the following roles. Additional roles may be adopted and documented by the Core Team. 2.1. Participants. \"Participants\" are persons that have made Contributions to the Project subject to the Community Specification License. 2.2. Core Team. The \"Core Team\" is the body that is responsible for governing the SWHID Project. The Core Team will meet regularly as needed, but no less then once per semester. Examples of the responsibilities of the Core Team include: * enable the smooth running of the SWHID Project; * participating in strategic planning, such as coordinating face-to-face meetings or suggesting and approving changes to the governance model; * making decisions when community consensus cannot be reached, pursuant to the Appeal Process documented below; * adopting and maintaining policies or rules and procedures for the Project as appropriate, such as a Code of Conduct, trademark policy, and any compliance or certification policies. 2.3. Maintainers. \"Maintainers\" are responsible for organizing activities around developing, maintaining, and updating the specification(s) developed by the Working Group. Maintainers are also responsible for determining consensus and coordinating appeals. The Core Team will designate one or more Maintainers for the Project. Examples of the responsibilities of Maintainers (directly or by delegation) include: * scheduling meetings, setting the agenda and keeping minutes; * leading the meetings and tracking progress; * reporting about progress to the community; * educating new Participants; * ensuring that the contents of materials accurately reflect the decisions that have been made by the Working Group. 2.4. Editors. \"Editors\" are responsible for ensuring that the contents of specifications produced by the Working Group are complete, coherent, and adhere to applicable formatting and content guidelines. The Core Team will designate one or more Editors for each specification document edited by the Working Group. 3. Decision Making. 3.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making. The project makes decisions through a consensus process (\"Approval\" or \"Approved\"). While the agreement of all Participants is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Participants and nature of support and objections. Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements, as well as minority opinions. 3.2. Appeal Process. Decisions may be appealed via submission of a pull request or an issue, and that appeal will be considered by the Maintainers in good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time. 3.3. Core Team Appeal Process. Decisions that have been appealed to the Maintainers may in extraordinary cases be appealed to the Core Team for reconsideration. An appeal to the Core Team must specify in detail: (1) the specific decision that is being appealed; (2) the basis for contending that the decision was not aligned with the purposes, goals or scope of the project; and (3) an explanation of why the decision is extraordinary enough to warrant an appeal to the Core Team. The appeal will be considered by the Core Team in good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time. The Core Team may decline to consider appeals that are unexceptional, unfounded or excessive, including because of their repetitive character. 3.4. Amendments to Governance Documents. The documents in this Governance may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire Core Team. However, entries may be added to the Notices file in this Governance repository as described therein. 4. Ways of Working. The SWHID Project must adhere to consensus-based due process requirements. These requirements apply to activities related to the development of consensus for approval, revision, reaffirmation, and withdrawal of the SWHID Specification. Due process means that any person (organization, company, government agency, individual, etc.) with a direct and material interest has a right to participate by: a) expressing a position and its basis, b) having that position considered, and c) having the right to appeal. Due process allows for equity and fair play. The following constitute the minimum acceptable due process requirements for the development of consensus. 4.1. Openness. Participation is open to all persons who are directly and materially affected by the activity in question. There will be no undue financial barriers to participation. Voting membership on the Working Group will not be conditional upon membership in any organization, nor unreasonably restricted on the basis of technical qualifications or other such requirements. 4.2. Lack of Dominance. The development process will not be dominated by any single interest category, individual or organization. Dominance means a position or exercise of dominant authority, leadership, or influence by reason of superior leverage, strength, or representation to the exclusion of fair and equitable consideration of other viewpoints. 4.3. Balance. The development process should be based upon a balance of interests. Participants from diverse interest categories will be sought with the objective of achieving balance. 4.4. Coordination and Harmonization. Good faith efforts will be made to resolve potential conflicts between and among deliverables developed under this Working Group and existing industry standards. 4.5. Consideration of Views and Objections. Prompt consideration will be given to the written views and objections of all Participants. 4.6. Written procedures. This governance document and other materials documenting the SWHID Specification development process are available to any interested person. 5. Specification Development Process. The following describes the public process by which new versions of the SWHID Specification as a whole can be transitioned from Draft Specification to Approved Specification status. 5.1. Draft. During the specification development process, Participants may submit issues and pull requests to the SWHID Specification repository. Pull requests will be merged upon Working Group approval by the Editors. Each updated version of the SWHID Specification following the merging of a pull request will be considered a \"Draft Specification\". 5.2. Process for Approved Specification status. Upon the determination by the Core Team that it has achieved the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, the Core Team will Approve that Draft Specification as a candidate for \"Approved Specification\" status. The following process will then be used: * An announcement will be made to the Working Group's general mailing list. * The Draft Specification will then be considered a candidate for \"Approved Specification\" status, following a two-week review period (the \"Review Period\"). * During the Review Period, any Participant may raise any issues regarding the Draft Specification. Such issues will be considered and resolved in the ordinary course. * The Core Team may, in its discretion, extend the Review Period for a longer period of time, but will not shorten it to be less than the initial two-week period. * After the completion of the Review Period and upon the Approval of the Working Group (which may include the absence of, or resolution in the ordinary course of, any issues raised during the Review Period), the Draft Specification will be progressed to be an \"Approved Specification\". 5.3. Publication. Upon the designation of a Draft Specification as an Approved Specification pursuant to the above process, the Core Team will publish the Approved Specification in a publicly available location, including the terms under which the Approved Specification is being made available. 5.4. Submissions to Standards Bodies. Only Approved Specifications may be submitted to another standards development organization. Upon reaching Approval, the Core Team will coordinate the submission of the applicable Approved Specification to another standards development organization. Participants that contributed to the Draft Specification or Approved Specification agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions. 6. Non-Confidential, Restricted Disclosure. Information disclosed in connection with any Working Group activity, including but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary. Meeting minutes will be published in summary form, as appropriate (e.g., sensitive matters may not be made public). If some work is performed by collaborating via a private repository (for a limited time), the Participants will not make any public disclosures of that information contained in that private repository.","title":"Governance"},{"location":"5._Governance/#swhid-project-governance-policy-02","text":"This document provides the governance policy for the SWHID Project.

Exceptions and Limitations.

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.

Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 \u2013 Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
